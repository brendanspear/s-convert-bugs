# S-Convert – Public Bug Tracker & Beta Feedback

Welcome! 👋  
This repository is used to **track bugs, conversion issues, and feedback** for **S-Convert**, a macOS utility for converting and preparing samples for vintage Akai samplers (S950, S1000, S1100, S3000, S3200, etc.).

👉 **This repo does NOT contain source code.**  
👉 It exists solely for **public beta feedback and issue tracking**.

---

## 🧪 Public Beta Status

SConvert is currently in **public beta**.

- The beta is provided **at no cost** while core conversion features are finalized.
- **Beta builds will stop functioning after January 31, 2026.**
- A stable release will be available before that date.

If your beta build has expired, please download the latest version from:  
👉 **https://s-convert.com/**

## 🐞 What to Report Here

Please open an issue here if you encounter:

- Conversion bugs (incorrect pitch, loops, envelopes, velocity, etc.)
- Crashes or freezes
- MIDI-related issues
- Audio playback problems
- Groove Sequencer bugs
- Hardware behavior that differs from expectations on a real Akai sampler

This tracker is especially important during the beta to help identify **edge cases across different sampler models and disks**.

## 🧾 How to Submit a Good Bug Report

## 🙏 Thank You

Thank you for helping test S-Convert.

Vintage samplers are quirky, inconsistent, and wonderful — and real-world feedback is the only way to make conversions truly reliable across hardware.

Your reports directly shape the final release.
